The GUI interface allows you to navigate folders/directories through clicks while the CLI navigates through typing commands. CLI allows users to complete tasks through text based commands instead of using a mouse on a GUI interface. CLI can be used to speed up the development process by displaying more information than you usually could using a GUI. While CLI can look more intimidating for beginners this interface allows users a quicker manipulation over files and directories than GUI.
